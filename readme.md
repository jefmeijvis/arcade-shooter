## How is it made?
The game runs in a browser from a [index.html](index.html) file.
The game logic is writtin in javascript, and [Phaser.js V3](https://www.https://phaser.io/phaser3.com "Phaser 3") was used to handle all the rendering, file handling and loading logic.


## How to run?
At the moment, you can easily self host the entire folder at a certain port on your localhost and visit that location. For convenience, a run.py script is included which wil host the game at localhost:11111
